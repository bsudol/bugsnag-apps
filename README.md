Sample applications with Bugsnag SDKs integrated to showcase Bugsnag functionality

1. Crash Loop Applications
- Android and iOS applications with Bugsnag SDK installed which are force crashed during launching. The Bugsnag SDK provides tools leveraged in these applications to detect consecutive launch crashes (crash loops) and take actions such as clearing cache, or turning off feature/experiment toggles to potentially remove problematic code or data, and allow the app to launch.
